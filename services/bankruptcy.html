			<h3>Bankruptcy</h3>
			<p>If you are considering filing for Bankruptcy,  a clear and accurate financial picture is of the utmost importance. Whether its Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, the value of your real estate will be a major component of this picture. Only an appraisal report , prepared by an  experienced and  certified professional can help you  establish this value. Our appraisal reports are accepted and used by New York Courts, the IRS , and other Agencies. All of our findings, conclusions and reports are confidential as required by the Uniform Standards  of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).</p>
