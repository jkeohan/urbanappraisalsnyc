			<h3>Divorce</h3>
			<p>A divorce proceeding will oftentimes  involve the value of real estate either owned by one or both parties . This situation will  call for a well supported, professional opinion of market value  that is defensible in court. This opinion will be relied on by attorneys, accountants and other interested parties in divorces and  other disputes requiring a value being placed on  property. 
			In cases,  where the divorce proceedings require a  retrospective appraisal with a unique effective date, we are very familiar with the procedures and requirements necessary to perform this type of assignment. All of our  findings, conclusions and reports are confidential as required by the Uniform Standards  of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).</p>
