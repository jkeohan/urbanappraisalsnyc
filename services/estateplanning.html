			<h3>Estate PLanning/Settlement</h3>
			<p>Executors, Attorneys and Accountants rely on our services and expertise to accommodate their legal and tax concerns. When settling an estate, we understand that a retrospective appraisal with a unique effective date known as the Date of Death (DOD), or a date within six months is required. Furthermore, you may want to accurately verify and limit your exposure to taxes, and correctly organize your property.  The IRS and other agencies may depend on the results of this type of appraisal report. Our team of appraisers is very experienced and knowledgeable with this type of assignment. All of our  findings, conclusions and reports are confidential as required by the Uniform Standards  of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).</p>
