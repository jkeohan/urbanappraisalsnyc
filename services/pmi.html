			<h3>PMI Removal</h3>
			<p>PMI is usually required when the borrowerâ€™s down payment or home equity is less than 20% of the total outstanding mortgage. An appraisal of your property will help eliminate the need for PMI once the 80% LTV (loan-to-value) condition has been established. As a result of removing the  PMI, there will be a reduction in your  monthly payments.  Our staff is very  experienced in assisting with PMI removal , and we will be happy to put our extensive experience to work for you.</p>
