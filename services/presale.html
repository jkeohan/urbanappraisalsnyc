			<h3>Pre-Sale/Pre-Purchase</h3>
			<p>An appraisal report can be an invaluable tool whether you are in the market as a buyer or a seller. If you are a seller, an appraisal will  help you set a realistic selling price so your home will attract more attention from buyers. If you are a buyer, a professional appraisal will serve as a strong negotiating tool, as it  gives you something concrete to show the seller. It's an independent third party's opinion of a  propertyâ€™s  market value, and a figure all parties can trust
and rely on. </p>
