			<h3>Tax Grievance</h3>
			<p>Quite often , the taxes which you pay for your property  will be higher than expected for the area. In this instance, a grievance  can be initiated to challenge the existing  assessment of your property. The first  step is to determine the current market value of your property.
			Information obtained from the Internet ( Zillow, Trulia, etc.,) will generally not be acceptable. This is a case where only a professionally prepared appraiser report  will suffice.
			By establishing the current market value of your property, our  team of  NY State Certified Appraisers  can  assist you in your quest to reduce your property  tax burden. </p>
